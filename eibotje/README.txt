This was my first design done while learning blender and it doesn't really
fit in terms of quality of the source code (I lost some blender file on the
way).

I am publishing this as I find the design simple and effective and we are nearing
easter. It started as and eggbot clone but my kids preferred to let the egg
turn and draw itself. The metal parts make is easy to create larget objects
without needing many hours of printing.

The Arduino code for this bot is *very* simple. Just Download the 
http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/AccelStepper/ library 
and compile "ArduinoCode" on an arduino.

Again uses the very simple and cheap 28BYJ-48-Stepper-Motor.
